Pinterest Web Scraper Project

Your Job:

At Pinterest, users like to pin items off of other people's websites.
We normally just grab the image and the url of the website, but
we want to start grabbing a lot more information from the website for our services.

We want you to write a more intelligent web scraper that will help us grab some
of the following information for sites of your choice:

Prices
Number of Items Available
Seller Information
Tags
Product Rating
Product Details
Product Title

This could work on sites such as Etsy, Amazon, Gap, or other sites of your choice.

Your Code:
Please write a small application that can read a csv of urls and images from a file.
For each url and image link it will download the image into a sub directory and store
its own json blob file of information for the urls. The schema is up to you, but it should
try to be as consistent for different sites as possible.

Please include tests with your code that show that your application works. This should
be more than just a csv that pulls back data, but actual tests that check the results
are what you are looking for.

Your code can be in any language of your choice. It can be a simple application that runs,
grabs the results, and shuts down when its finished processing the file.


Extra Features:
A lot of times users end up pinning the home page instead of the actual entry they
are trying to pin. Try extending this to grab a better url for the item.
For example on a blog they will pin the main feed instead of the actual article
they were trying to pin. This makes it hard for users looking at the pin to find
the correct information.

Try to avoid being blocked by websites. A lot of time websites will block downloading
images or pages if the user agent or the referrer information is suspicious.
